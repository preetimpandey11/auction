## Overview

The Auction Service API allows management of auctions, products, and bids. It provides endpoints for:

- Creating and viewing auctions
- Adding products to auctions
- Placing bids on products
- Closing auctions

The API uses **Bearer token authentication** to secure all the endpoints.
The token must be generated by using the **/api/v1/auth/token** api in the user service
